# NN++

This is NN++, short for NeuralNetwork++.

This is simply a place for me to create a Neural Network. From scratch. Using C++.

It's gonna be fun.

## Useful Functions

### Sigmoid

$$
\text{sigmoid}(x) = f(x) = \frac1{1+e^{-x}}
$$

### Hyperbolic Tangent

$$
\tanh(x)=f(x)=\frac2{1+e^{-2x}}-1
$$

### ReLU

$$
\text{ReLU}(x) = f(x) = \text{max}\{0,x\}
$$
